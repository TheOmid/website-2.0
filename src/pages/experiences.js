          Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars (MRADS)

        <div class="text-justify tracking-tight px-2 py-2">
          I have been involved in MRADS for two years now, and it has been the
          best decision I have made in college so far. MRADS has helped me by
          providing resources, mentors and advisors to get involved in research
          during my first year. More importantly, I found many loyal, supportive
          friends through MRADS. We have gone through ups and downs of college
          together for two years, and I cannot imagine my college experiences
          without my MRADS friends. I was living with people from many different
          walks of life in my dorm everyday, and I am glad we were able to
          create a welcoming, inclusive community. As a sophomore, I am a
          sophomore leader in the community, and I help first-years to adjust to
          college life and academics. This has been an incredible leadership
          experience, and I have met many inspiring, ambituous individuals. I
          hope I can stay involved in MRADS however I can in the future. In
          short, I have learned about communication, cultural awareness,
          and leadership.

          I have been able to grow professionally and meet many interesting
          people through my involvement in MProduct. I have learned about
          Product Management, UI/UX, business, and many other aspects of a
          product besides the technicalities. As a member of Education team, I
          have been able to learn even more about PM, collaborate with other
          Education team members, and practice public speaking by holding
          workshops and discussions for the general members of our organization.
          I have been also able to find mentors who have provided invaluable
          college and career advice.

          Research Assistant @ Taubman College of Architecture
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify tracking-tight px-2 py-2">
          I have gained experience working on real-world projects with teams
          outside of the classroom. During 2019-2020 academic year, I worked
          with a team of faculty, engineers, architects, and artists during my
          experience as an undergraduate research assistant. In this role, I was
          responsible for creating a workflow that allowed our research team to
          create digital objects and display them using Augmented Reality(AR)
          technologies. I worked with technologies such ARKit and APIs such as
          Scene Geometry and 3D scanning throughout the duration of this
          project. While I worked independently on the technical portion of the
          project, I frequently communicated with my mentors and presented my
          progress weekly so that I was able to share their vision and meet the
          collective goals of the group. The completed product was a
          user-friendly, reliable application that allowed architects to build
          custom structures and display them as AR objects. The product received
          recognition for innovation from the Taubman College of Architecture
          and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan.

          I play Polo! Michigan polo club has been a fun experience that was cut
          short due to the pandemic unfortunately. I look foward to
          learning/playing polo once we are back on campus. Not only it has been
          a good time, but I also have learned teamwork, resilience, and
          consistency.
