        Hello, I'm Omid Shahidi. I am a junior studying Computer Science and
        Data Science (with a minor in Philosophy) at the University of
        Michigan-College of Engineering. As an aspiring engineer, I love working
        with multidisciplinary teams, and I believe my biggest strength lies in
        collaboration with engineers, artists, and designers. Right now, my
        research team and I are aiming to turn sleep data into ambient,
        electronic music! Outside of school, I am always trying to learn new
        things, and to explore different hobbies. Right now, I am very interested
        in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, and Cloud Computing.  

        I am watching countless hours of Ted Talks on YouTube.
        
        Once upon a time, I hosted a podcast,{" "}

        about their life stories revolving around a topic related to personal
        growth and philosphy. I am working on something new, so stay tuned!ðŸ‘€
